# Intro

Gyro! is a personal Wiki. You can use it as a general note-taking app.

It's available in several different flavours:

* Client-server
* Chrome extension
* Desktop app

In all cases it should behave the same.

The basic concept is that you have as many pages as you want, with whatever content you want. Each page is identified by a *path* such as "/index" or "/expenses/may".

The content in the pages is written in a language called "Markdown", which aims to be simple to learn and can be easily converted to HTML or other formats you may find useful.

If you really like this, feel free to [send me money](paypal.me/ralsina) I promise to spend it unwisely.



# Creating Pages

<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" aria-label="New Page"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>

To create a new page, click on that button and write what the path of the new page is. Alternatively, if you create a link to a page that doesn't exist, you can follow that link and open the page. Then, if you put content there, it's created.

# Editing Pages

<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" aria-label="Edit Page"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-edit" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>


## Markdown Syntax

Something like this [markdown reference](http://commonmark.org/help/) and [tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)
